# Home Assistant, ESPHome, Nginx, and Docker
A lot of people run Home Assistant for their home automation system. Quite a few of those people try to avoid "the cloud" and use only locally controlled devices. But I don't think a lot of folks run their Home Assistant in Docker containers. That's what this repository is for. It's a place where I share my configurations for Home Assistant, running in Docker containers, and avoiding cloud connections.
